#2.8 Reflections
**How was your experience translating a wireframe into HTML?**

It was great already having the wireframe so that it made it very quick to develop it.

**What new tricks or elements did you learn about in HTML?**

I learned how to use the "style=" a lot since we are not allowed to use CSS files at the 
moment. I also learned about the button and input tags, which can be useful to create 
forms or my contact form, for instance.

**Are you excited to start incorporating the design you chose next week?**

Yes.
