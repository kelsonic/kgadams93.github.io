        <p class="blog-content">
          Born and raised in Colorado, I sought to study outside of the United States 
          immediately after high school to learn more about the world. I decided to 
          go to Rome, Italy, where I studied at <a href="http://www.johncabot.edu/">John Cabot University</a> 
          (an American university).
        </p>
        
        <h4>Netherlands</h4>
        
        <p class="blog-content">
          I graduated with a Bachelor's of Arts in International Affairs and a Bachelor's of 
          Arts in International Business. Desiring to get experience in the tech startup world,
          I moved to the Amsterdam-area in the Netherlands. I joined a tech startup called 
          <a href="http://landing.bomberbot.com/">Bomberbot</a>, whose mission it is to teach 
          kids how to code.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Bomberbot: Teaching kids to code.</h4>
        
        <p class="blog-content">
          I was inspired by the team's CEO, who recommended me to get into programming. 
          Upon that advice, I joined 3+ Ruby on Rails online bootcamps, which 
          gave me a great overview of how to make Rails apps. That said, I still felt 
          as though I was missing formal education in programming.
        </p>
        
        <h4>That's when I came across Dev Bootcamp.</h4>
        
        <p class="blog-content">
          Upon acceptance into DBC, I did a little dance and, since then, I have been preparing 
          for the move from the Netherlands to San Francisco, California. My mission is to 
          learn even more about Rails and to become a professional Ruby on Rails developer.
