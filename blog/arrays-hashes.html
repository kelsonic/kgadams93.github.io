          Many people (myself included) had trouble distinguishing the difference 
          between arrays and hashes when first starting to program.
          
          So let's talk a bit about them both.
        </p>
        
        <p class="blog-content">
          If you haven't already checked out <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/">ruby-doc.org</a>, 
          now would be a good time. 
          
          It's incredible how much you can learn by reading their documentation on Ruby,
          and they give great definitions of both <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html">arrays</a> 
          and <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Hash.html">hashes</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Arrays</h4>
        
        <p class="blog-content">
          "Arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object." While that 
          may seem like a mouth-full, the concept is quite simple.
          
          For example, here is an array:
          
          <code>new_array = [1, "hello", ["this is an element in a subarray", 5], 3]</code>
        </p>
        
        <p class="blog-content">
          An array contains either numbers, strings, or even other arrays (as shown above.) 
          
          They can be very useful if you need to store or retrieve a large amount of data.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Hashes</h4>
        
        <p class="blog-content">
          "A Hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values." 
          Essentially, a hash contains a bunch of key-value pairs and, while it is 
          similar to an array, it has some notable differences.
        </p>
        
        <p class="blog-content">
          First, indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type. Let's take 
          a quick look at indexing for arrays. For example, if this is your array: 
          
          <code>new_array = ["hello", "yes", "no"]</code> 
          
          then <code>new_array(0) = "hello"</code>, <code>new_array(1) = "yes"</code>, 
          and so forth.
        </p>
        
        <p class="blog-content">
          However, hashes are a bit different. Let's say this is your hash:
          
          <code>greetings = { :friendly => "Hello, beautiful!", :angry => "Hello, not beautiful!" }</code>
          
          Hash indexing is done like this: 
          
          <code>greetings[friendly] = "Hello, beautiful!"</code>
        </p>
        
        <h4>So when should you use them?</h4>
        
        <p class="blog-content">
          Both hashes and arrays store data and allow you to retrieve that data. 
          
          However, the way in which you can retrieve and store that data is different for 
          both arrays and hashes.
        </p>
        
        <p class="blog-content">
          Arrays have fixed keys, as seen with their numerical indexing, whereas 
          hash keys are much easier to customize.
