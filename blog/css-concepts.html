          One of the most confusing properties of CSS for beginners is <code>position:</code>.
          
          For most it may seem intuitive at first, but there are many values for it, 
          which can make it difficult to remember.
        </p>
        
        <p class="blog-content">
          Let's just put it out there - positioning in CSS sucks to work with when 
          starting out.
          
          And it also happens to be important since it will help create the layout 
          your envisoning for your website.
          
          Since positioning seems to be a combination of confusing and useful, let's 
          try to make it simpler to understand.
        </p>
        
        <h4>The Key Position</h4>
        
        <p class="blog-content">
          The definition from <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp" alt="w3schools">w3schools</a> 
          for position is this:
        </p>
        
        <p class="blog-content">
          The <code>position</code> property specifies the type of positioning 
          method used for an element (static, relative, fixed or absolute).
        </p>
        
        <p class="blog-content">
          While that pretty much states the obvious, what might not be so obvious is 
          that it actually creates an algorithm for the element that you are targeting, 
          which determines its position.
          
          This is pretty cool, so let's go more in-depth into the types of values this 
          property takes to understand how it works under-the-hood.
        </p>
        
        <h4>The Static Value</h4>
        
        <p class="blog-content">
          Static is the default value for the position property. 
          
          An element with <code>position: static;</code> is not positioned in any special way. 
          
          This is great news for us, because it means that the element will simply 
          follow the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp">box model</a>.
          
          In fact, an element with <code>position: static;</code> is said to not 
          be positioned at all.
        </p>
        
        <h4>The Absolute Value</h4>
        
        <p class="blog-content">
          The absolute value is perhaps the most confusing value for the position 
          property, so let's get it out of the way.
          
          An absolutely positioned element will either use its parent element or 
          the HTML body to position itself.
          
          (Imagine you are absolutely positioning a <code>h2</code> tag inside of a 
          <code>div</code>. 
          
          The <code>h2</code> position will be relative to the 
          <code>div</code> instead of the entire HTML <code>body</code> tag.)
        </p>
        
        <p class="blog-content">
          In order to manipulate an absolutely positioned element, it's actually 
          quite easy.
          
          The most useful properties to use with <code>position: absolute;</code> 
          is <code>top:</code>, <code>bottom:</code>, <code>left:</code>, 
          <code>right:</code>, <code>width:</code>, and <code>height:</code>.
        </p>
        
        <h4>The Relative Value</h4>
        
        <p class="blog-content">
          The relative value is almost the same as static, except that you can 
          manipulate its position.
          
          As with <code>position: absolute;</code>, you can use the above properties 
          to change a relative positioned element.
          
          So if you want to manipulate a static positioned element, make sure you 
          change its position to relative.
        </p>
        
        <h4>The Fixed Value</h4>
        
        <p class="blog-content">
          If an element has <code>position: fixed;</code> it means that the element 
          will be positioned with respect to your device's viewport.
          
          Even if you scroll, the element will stay in the same location on your 
          screen.
          
          And as with absolute and relative positioning, you can use the above 
          properties to manipulate the element's position.
