        This is my first post at Dev Bootcamp! One of the most fascinating aspects to the challenges this week was discovering the various licenses you can attach to GitHub projects. As soon as you click that list to add a license to your project, the first thing that will undoubtedly pop into your head is 'Whoa, that's a lot of licenses.' The second thing might be 'which license is right for me?'

        If you haven't already, check out <a href="http://choosealicense.com" alt="Choosealicense.com">Choose A License</a>. They make it very simple to understand the differences between various licenses, particularly the MIT License, Apache License, and the GPL License. Let's look at the most widely-used license - The MIT License.

        It's a relatively <a href="http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/" alt="MIT License" >short document</a>, but it might not be as fun to read as <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/10-ridiculous-eula-clauses-agreed/">iTunes' EULA license agreement</a>, which forbids you from using iTunes to create nuclear weapons. At any rate, the MIT License lets others do anything they want with your code - but they do need to provide attribution back to you and they cannot hold you liable for anything they may make with your project (including iTunes nuclear weapon software).
