  <!--How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?-->
  <!--    It was very nice to be able to look at both of our wireframes and immediately be able -->
  <!--    to develop a basic version of them with HTML. We both learned a variety of different-->
  <!--    HTML tags that will be useful when building other web pages later on.-->
  <!--Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?-->
  <!--    Wireframing is very helpful to the development process because you do not have to -->
  <!--    waste any time designing the overall structure of the website. I will absolutely -->
  <!--    use it in the future.-->
  <!--What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? -->
  <!--    Both of our wireframes were sleek and were not too cluttered. It is important to keep-->
  <!--    wireframes simple for users interfacing with it.-->
  <!--What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?-->
  <!--    I had used the <header> tag improperly beforehand and used it in place of the <h1> tag -->
  <!--    occasionally. However, upon further research I realized that it is best used as a wrapper.-->
