#Reflection for 3.5
**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**

I often used Chrome DevTools computed section to analyze the size, padding, border, and margin of an element. I was able to manipulate them quite easily after understanding the stack order (priority order?) of CSS (ie. user agent styles last, user styles second, author styles first).

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

For the navbar, I used position:absolute for the logo. It was easy to implement by using margin:auto and defining a width for the element so it did not overlap other elements. Positioning is very important, particularly for objects that you need in a fixed place on the screen.

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**

I found the divs very easy to manipulate and customize. I was able to add background colors, border-radius, borders, etc. very easily to these elements. I found the navbar logo the most difficult to correctly position originally because I did not want the heading tag to overlap other elements inside the navbar.

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**

I learned a ton about how to manipulate elements with Chrome DevTools and how easy it is to copy the customized css into your own css files. Adding elements is quite easy as well, though you must do it in your HTML before you manipulate their styles with CSS.
